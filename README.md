# odin-recipes

Hi I'm Jeanne. I am starting out again with learning web development programming with TOP. This is the first exercise given in "The Odin Project" which requires me to make a HTML website about recipes and I had fun making this. It's not that hard yet since this is quite a refresher for me but I am looking forward for the CSS and Javascript area of the curriculum. I hope I can handle the challenges well and overcome it with flying colors. Thank you everyone who took time to look into my first coding exercise. Wish me luck!
